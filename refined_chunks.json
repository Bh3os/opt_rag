He\nhas held faculty positions with the Engineering-Economic Systems Dept..\nStanford University and the Electrical Engineering Dept. of the U n i ~ ~ r -\nsity of Illinois, Urbana. He is currently Professor of E l e c t r i d Engiiieeriiig\nand Computer Science a t the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He",
  "consults regularly with private industry and has held editorial positions in\nseveral journals. He has been elected Fellow of the IEEE.\nProfessor Bertselias has done research in a broad variety of si~bjects\nfrom optimization theory, control theory, parallel and distributed coinputa-\ntion; data communication networks, and systems analysis. He has n-ritten\nnunlerous papers in each of these areas.\n\nOther books by the author:\n\n1) Dgnamic Programming and Stochastic Conkroll Academic Press. 1976.\n2) Stochastic Optima,l Control: The Discrete- Time Case.
